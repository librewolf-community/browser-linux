#### NOTE: It is not recommended to use Tor with current builds of librewolf

### LibreWolf Addons For ESR And Tor

- [LibreWolf HTTP Watcher ESR - Tor MoD](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/LibreWolf-http-watcher-tor-mod/): Change the url bar color on http and onion sites (to green/red)
- [LibreWolf NoHTTP - Tor MoD](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/nohttp-LibreWolf-mod-for-tor/): Block http traffic and/or redirect it to https (Excellent replacement for the unrecommended https-everywhere)

## Tor Compatibility

We do not recommend connecting over Tor on LibreWolf classic version (because of the missing LibreWolf-Tor-Addons, they are only included in the tor version for obvious reasons), use instead LibreWolf-Tor version if your threat model calls for it, or for accessing hidden services (Thus said tor settings have been enabled since v2 on all LibreWolf versions for user toriffying/proxifying their entire connection).

Currently LibreWolf-TBB is in beta test, Tor compatibility may change.
