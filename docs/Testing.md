## Browser Tests

### Security/Fingerprint

Firefox 60 and `privacy.resistFingerprinting` are relatively new, please give it some time to be more widely used and thus less finger-printable; If you are using a different site to analyze your browser make sure to read and understand what the test is about.

### Performances
